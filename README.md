# MML: MyMusicList

## A musical vitual comunity and data base

In the musical field, Spotify is the most widely used multiplatform music streaming application. Music as such is a social phenomenon, but the social options that Spotify offers are very limited. From this need and based on the concept used in the **MyAnimeList** web application, the idea for **MyMusicList** project arose, since [MyAnimeList.net](myanimelist.net) is a social network and database for the animation and manga community, mainly Japanese.

**MyMusicList** project proposes the design and implementation of a simple musical social network for all Spotify users interested in discovering more music and also more people with the same musical tastes.
